     ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   - Run this command to activate the virtual environment:
     ```sh
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   If `py` doesn't work, try using `python` or `python3` instead.

5. **Install dependencies**:
   - Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies by running:
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## 2. **Playing the Game**

### Running the Game

1. After completing the setup, **run the game** by executing the `VisualBoard.py` script:
   - For Windows or Mac, simply run:
     ```sh
     python VisualBoard.py
     ```

### Game Controls

Once the game is running, you can interact with it using the following keybindings:

- **Q**: Leave the game
- **Spacebar**: Hit (draw a card)
- **S**: Stand (end your turn)
- **D**: Double (double your bet and draw one more card)
- **R**: Ready (ready to start a new game)
- **E**: Start or End the game (depending on the state)

## 3. **Additional Notes**

- **Virtual Environment**: It is recommended to use the virtual environment to avoid conflicts with system-wide Python packages.
- **Dependencies**: All dependencies required to run the game are listed in `requirements.txt`. This file is automatically created by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing all necessary packages.
